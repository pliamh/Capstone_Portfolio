# Patrick Horgan — Applied Data Science Capstone Portfolio


## Scalable Retail Analytics: From Spreadsheets to a Production-Ready ML Pipeline

End-to-end project building a normalized relational database, professional data-quality pipeline, and forecasting models for a growing grocery chain (3 → 10 stores).  
Work includes schema design (Postgres), reliable ETL, feature engineering (calendar, holiday, weather), and short-term demand forecasting with backtesting and clear business recommendations.

**What’s inside**
- Database: ERD → 3NF schema (Postgres) + idempotent ETL  
- Data Quality: systematic audits, imputations, leakage checks  
- Forecasting: SARIMA/Prophet and tree-based baselines with regressors (dow, holiday, weather)  
- Reports: executive summaries, visuals, and model evaluation
